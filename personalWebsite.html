      <h2>My Profile</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Hey, You there welcome to my personal website. It reads as personal but
        as warming as i am sharing it with you guys. I'm Denkyi Bright
        Acheampong, also known as <em>King Kuuta</em>. I'm from Kwahu Fodoa a
        Town in the Eastern region of Ghana.
        </p>
        <p>
       I attended
        <strong> Sovereign International School </strong> for my Junior High and
        <strong> Okuapemman School</strong> for Senior High . I'm currently
        school at <em> Ghana Communication Technology University </em> where I'm
        pursing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology and currently in
        Level 300 to be an aspiring software programmer.
      </p>
      <p>No one comes in this world at the stage where I am right now, without the support of family and friends. In fact, what I am today, is because of my family. My father is a reputable business man in our community. My mothers is a doctor. They both love their profession. Thatâ€™s I have learned from my parents. That is,  the value of time, sincerity, hard work and dedication to the purpose.</p>
